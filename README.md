# Journal App 
# (Front end repo: https://github.com/HBrahmbhatt/journal-web)

## Overview
This **Journal App** is designed to help users securely and intuitively document  their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Built with **Java Spring Boot** microservices and **MongoDB**, the app is designed with scalability, flexibility, and security in mind. Each microservice follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**, ensuring maintainable and modular code.

## Key Features
- **Emotion Tags**: Tag journal entries with emotions for easy categorization and search.
- **Authentication & Security**: Integrated **Spring Security** for secure user authentication, with plans to implement **OAuth** for third-party login in the future.
- **Logging & Code Quality**: Enabled comprehensive logging, integrated **SonarQube** for code quality monitoring, and created **JUnit** test cases for reliability and scalability.
- **Microservices Architecture**: A multi-layered, modular microservices architecture for easy maintenance and separation of concerns.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Spring Boot** (for backend)
- **MongoDB** (for scalable data storage)
- **Spring Security** (for user authentication)
- **SonarQube** (for code quality monitoring)
- **JUnit** (for unit testing)
- **OAuth** (upcoming integration)

## Development Goals
This ongoing project helps refine skills in **microservices**, **security**, and **cloud-native application development**, while also exploring the use of **AI** for future feature enhancements.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Integrating **LLM-based** (Large Language Model) summaries to generate concise, reflective summaries of journal entries over specified time periods.
